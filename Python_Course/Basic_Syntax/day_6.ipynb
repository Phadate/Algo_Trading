    "### Day 6: Error Handling and Exceptions in Python\n",
    "Error handling is a crucial part of writing any code, especially in complex tasks like quantitative analysis where unexpected errors can occur. Understanding how to handle these errors gracefully will help you debug faster and ensure your programs don’t crash unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What are Errors and Exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Errors are problems in the code that cause the program to fail, like syntax errors or wrong data types.\n",
    "-   Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. Instead of crashing your program, exceptions can be caught and handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Common Types of Errors in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "-   SyntaxError: When the syntax of the code is incorrect (e.g., missing a colon `:` after an `if` statement).\n",
    "-   TypeError: When an operation is performed on an inappropriate data type (e.g., adding a string to an integer).\n",
    "-   NameError: When a variable is not defined.\n",
    "-   ValueError: When a function gets an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value (e.g., converting a letter to an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Try-Except Block\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-except` block is used to handle exceptions gracefully, allowing you to manage errors without crashing your program.\n",
